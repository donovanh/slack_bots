## TODO

Look into using [Cleverbot](http://cleverbot.io) for more nuance.

Create a "morning" response that:

* Greets with a cheery message
* Gives an update on today's weather
* Lists out some news headlines

Create a "what's new / news" response that lists the headlines only

Have Samwise interject on matters relating to horticulture or second breakfast

Update the wording to be more Samwise.
